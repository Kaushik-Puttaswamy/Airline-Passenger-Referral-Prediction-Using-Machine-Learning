# Airline_Passenger_Referral_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

Project Summary
The project aims to predict whether a passenger referred by an existing customer will book a flight or not, based on various features such as seat comfort, cabin service, travel class,food beverage , entertainment service, etc. The prediction model is developed using classification techniques in machine learning.The use of machine learning techniques allows for the development of a model that can learn from historical passenger and booking data and make accurate predictions on new data. The model can be used by airlines to target marketing campaigns towards potential passengers who are likely to book a flight based on a referral from an existing customer.

Objective
The given data includes airline reviews from 2016 to 2019 for popular airlines around the world with multiple choice and free text questions. Data is scrapped in spring2019.The main objective is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to their friends.

Conclusion
• Solo Lesisure has the highest value counts, we can conclude that most people who travel by airline travel is solo.37.22% people who travel by airline is solo. Followed by couple and family.

• We can conclude that most of the people around 78.44% people choose economy class to travel by airline. Followed by Business class and others.

• 50% passenger are giving 4.0 and 5.0 rating for cabin-service when overall rating of airline is good. So we can say good cabin-service positively impacts airline businesses.

• 30% people are not satisfied with entertainment service. As they give 1.0 rating.

• 38% people are giving 4.0 and 5.0 rating for seat comfort. So overall rating is bad. So we can say that bad value for entertainment service negatively impact airline business.

• 42% passengers gave an overall rating below 3.0 . So it, suggests that people are not very much satisfied with airline services. There are still need of improvements

• We performed Hyperparameter tuning using Grid search CV method for Decision Tree Model, Random Forest Model , K-Nearest Neighbour ,Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes. To increase accuracy and avoid Overfitting Criteria, this is done.

• We have built classifier models using 6 different types of classifiers and all these are able to give accuracy of more than 90%.We can conclude that Logistic Regression gives the best model.

• Model evaluation metrics comparison, we can see that Support Vector Machine being the model with highest accuracy rate by a very small margin, works best among the experimented models for the given dataset.

• The most important feature are overall rating and Value for money that contribute to a model's prediction whether a passenger will recommended a particular airline to his/her friends.

• In order to increase their business or grow, our client must provide excellent cabin service, ground service, food-beverage entertainment, and seat comfort.
