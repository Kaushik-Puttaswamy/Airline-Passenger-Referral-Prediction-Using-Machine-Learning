# Airline_Passenger_Referral_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

Project Summary
The project aims to predict whether a passenger referred by an existing customer will book a flight or not, based on various features such as seat comfort, cabin service, travel class,food beverage , entertainment service, etc. The prediction model is developed using classification techniques in machine learning.The use of machine learning techniques allows for the development of a model that can learn from historical passenger and booking data and make accurate predictions on new data. The model can be used by airlines to target marketing campaigns towards potential passengers who are likely to book a flight based on a referral from an existing customer.
